# Azure Machine Learning - Linear Regresssion Model
_Auto Price Training_ model evaluated using linear regression in Azure Machine Learning  

## Introduction  
* _Regression_ is a form of machine learning that is used to predict a numeric label based on an item's features.  
* Regression is an example of a supervised machine learning technique in which you train a model using data that includes both the features and known values for the label, so that the model learns to fit the feature combinations to the label.  
* You can use Microsoft Azure Machine Learning designer to create regression models by using a drag and drop visual interface, without needing to write any code.

## Procedure 
1. Create an Azure Machine Learning workspace.(Make some suitable changes for the workspace according to your requirement.  
2. Create compute resources and targets.
3. Explore data  
     * Create a pipeline  
     * Add and explore the dataset
     * Add data transformations
     * Run the pipeline
     * View the transformed data
4. Create and run a training pipeline  
     * Add training modules
     * Run the training pipeline  
5. Evaluate a regression model
     * Add an Evaluate Model module  
     
## Output  
We will get our Auto Price Training model with no-code methodology.
